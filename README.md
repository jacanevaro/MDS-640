##🔭Project Summary

An analysis of user behavior and weather patterns to predict the number of registered users during a given timeframe.
-
- Data Visualization
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Exponential Smoothing

The optimal outcome is a model that accurately predicts the **number of registered users** for January 2013 based on data from 2011 and 2012.
